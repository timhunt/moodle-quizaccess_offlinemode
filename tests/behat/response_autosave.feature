  @javascript
  Scenario: When a response is saved, the question state changes to "Answer changed".
    When I press "Attempt quiz"
    And I click on "True" "radio" in the "Answer me A" "question"
    Then the state of "Answer me A" question is shown as "Answer changed"
    And "#quiznavbutton1.answersaved" "css_element" should exist
    And I click on "Finish attempt ..." "link" in the "Quiz navigation" "block"
    And I should see "Answer changed" in the "1" "table_row"
    # Now successfully navigate away, or the following test will fail.
    And I click on "C1" "link" confirming the dialogue

  @javascript
  Scenario: When a response is changed, it is auto-saved & the status changes to "Answer saved"
    When I press "Attempt quiz"

    Then the state of "Answer me A" question is shown as "Answer saved"
    And "#quiznavbutton1.answersaved" "css_element" should exist
    And I click on "Finish attempt ..." "link" in the "Quiz navigation" "block"
